### Helm Chart:
A Helm chart is a package containing pre-configured Kubernetes resources (such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.) that define a set of resources needed to run a specific application or service.
Charts are used to define, package, and version Kubernetes applications, making it easier to deploy and manage complex applications on Kubernetes clusters.
Each Helm chart typically consists of a set of templates (in the form of YAML files) and a Chart.yaml file that contains metadata about the chart, including its name, version, and description.

ðŸ‘‰ Helm command used to search a helm chart in a helm repo:
```shell
helm show chart stx-platform/secret-observer
```
### Helm Release:
A Helm release is an instance of a Helm chart that has been installed on a Kubernetes cluster.
When you install a Helm chart onto a Kubernetes cluster, Helm generates a release, which represents the deployment of that chart's resources onto the cluster.
A Helm release includes information about the deployed resources (e.g., Kubernetes objects like Pods, Services, ConfigMaps) and any configured options or overrides provided during installation.
Each release is uniquely identified by a release name and can have multiple revisions as you upgrade or rollback the release over time.

```shell
helm list
```
***In summary, a Helm chart defines the Kubernetes resources needed for an application, while a Helm release represents the deployment of those resources onto a
Kubernetes cluster with specific configurations and overrides. The Helm chart is a static definition of the application, while the Helm release is a dynamic 
instance of that chart deployed onto a Kubernetes cluster.***
